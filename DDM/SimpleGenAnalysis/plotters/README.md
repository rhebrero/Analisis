# Plotters

This folder contains basic plotter scripts that work with the output of the `analyzers` folder. 

1. `plotsSimpleGenTriggerSim.py` works with the output `SimpleGenTriggerSim.py`

2. `plotsSimpleGenTriggerSim_RPVvsBenchmark.py` works with the output `SimpleGenTriggerSim_RPVvsBenchmark.py`

These scripts have been tested in Vienna.
